### Steps

- p2p connection making
- signaling through STUN servers to interconnect p2p
- cause NAT (network action transaction ) of routers changes ip constantly
- ICE helps to establish and stabilize ip connection with STUN

- ICE candidates (avaiable ports/ip by each peer)
- saved on DB by server to maintain connectivity
